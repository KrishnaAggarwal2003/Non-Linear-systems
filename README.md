# Non-Linear Systems.

This repository explains several examples of Non-linear systems studied in Physics and Computational sciences.

## Rossler System

[Rossler_system.ipynb](https://github.com/KrishnaAggarwal2003/Non-Linear-systems/blob/main/Rossler_system.ipynb) file contains the equations for the **Rossler System**. It depicts the oscillatory and chaotic behaviour in the form of plots for varying all 3 parameters in the model along with the <u> Bifurcation diagram </u> for all 3 parameters.

## Other Systems

[Dynamic_Systems.ipynb](https://github.com/KrishnaAggarwal2003/Non-Linear-systems/blob/main/Dynamic_Systems.ipynb) file contains equation of **Lorentz system** along with two examples of attractor:-
* Limit cycle attractor
* Point attractor
